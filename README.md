# Bank Marketing – Decision Tree Classification

This project builds a Decision Tree classifier on the Bank Marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. It includes dataset extraction, label encoding of categorical features, train–test splitting, model training, evaluation, and decision tree visualization.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Bank Marketing Dataset
- **Target Variable:** `y` (term deposit subscription)

## Method
- Label Encoding for categorical data
- Decision Tree (Gini index, max depth = 5)
- Train/Test split (80/20)

## Evaluation
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
